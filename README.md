# sgmcmc: a stochastic gradient MCMC package for R

`sgmcmc` implements a lot of the popular stochastic gradient MCMC methods including SGLD, SGHMC and SGNHT. The package uses automatic differentiation, so all the differentiation needed for the methods is calculated automatically. Control variate methods can be used in order to improve the efficiency of the methods as proposed in the [recent publication](to be added).
