## CITATION Addition

The DOI in the CITATION is for a new JSS publication that will be registered after publication on CRAN.

## Email Change

Email had to be changed since University email has expired. I no longer have access to the previous email(j.baker1@lancaster.ac.uk), so cannot confirm from the previous email (sorry about that).

## Test environments
System requirements fully met:
* Ubuntu 14.04 (on travis-ci), R release and R-devel
* Windows Server 2016 (Microsoft Azure Virtual Machine), R 3.4.1

TensorFlow package not properly installed with `sgmcmc::installTF()`:

## R CMD check restults
There were no ERRORs, WARNINGs or NOTEs.

## Downstream dependencies
There are two downstream dependencies: tensorflow, reticulate.

* tensorflow: R CMD check: 0 ERRORs | 0 WARNING | 0 NOTE
* reticulate: R CMD check: 0 ERRORs | 0 WARNING | 0 NOTE
